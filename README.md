# Luks Headers Restoring

This script automates LUKS encryption management tasks. It dynamically detects LUKS-encrypted devices and performs three key functions: adding a nuke key for emergency data destruction, backing up the LUKS header for recovery purposes, and restoring the header when needed. It uses cryptsetup for LUKS operations and openssl for encrypting backup files, ensuring security. The script requires no manual edits, as all configurations are automated, and includes an intuitive command-line interface with usage instructions.
